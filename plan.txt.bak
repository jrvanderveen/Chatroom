1) For this program we will be building a basic chatroom.  255 people will be able to chat together at a time.
Each client that connects will have a terminal to enter their messages to the chatroom and a terminal to view the group thread.
2) No faults.
3) Keeping every client and their thread up to date with everyone seems like the hardest part.  Beyond that it is just sending and recieveing.
4) http://www.geeksforgeeks.org implementation with a few added functions like fillTree() and free() writting by us.
